**Instructions**: Please precede all your answers with the question you are answering. Use acronyms only after you've explained them. Use correct spelling and grammar. Be sure to write your name and the interviewer’s name.

**Candidate’s Name**: Alex Oswald

1. **Are you currently employed?**

Part time, yes. I currently work at a boutique hotel & conduct some freelance data & engineering work.

1. **What are the responsibilities of a Software Engineer?**

The core tenets of being a software engineer are problem solving, adaptability, and being able to write replicable code your team can understand & pickup. While projects may range between app development, DevOps, MLOps, Full Stack development, embedded development and more, there are core principles of good software engineering that all depend on solid foundations. When put into practice, this culminates to the responsibilities of a software engineer being well versed in their project or domain environments, knowing what resources to seek, how, and when, and being able to write code their team understands and can pickup without being walked through how it works (often via well commented or documented code).

3. **What interests you about software development?**

What captivates me about software development is the blend of creativity and logic it demands. It’s the thrill of transforming abstract ideas into tangible, impactful solutions. Each line of code is a building block towards something greater, a tool that can solve real-world problems and improve lives. The constant evolution and learning required in this field keep me engaged and drive my passion for continuous improvement and innovation.

4. **Have you ever disagreed with a coworker? Tell me about it and how you resolved it.**

At my previous post as a Data Scientist at a stealth stage consulting/data brokerage startup, my boss proposed how he wanted me to implement his design of a dynamic "works on any input" consumer archetype intelligence model. I disagreed with his methodology and pointed out that from a sampling perspective, I thought his approach would be statistically insignificant. We decided to take some time to each work out the math individually, flesh out our designs, push the meeting  back a week. The next week we had a more informed discussion about the merits, numbers, and listened to each others approaches; we ultimately collaborated to design the model following my data architecture design but a mix of our clustering methods.

5. **Explain OOP. Can you explain why it’s important?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) uses principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create modular and reusable code, modeling real-world entities for better maintainability. Unlike functional programming, which focuses on functions and immutability, OOP organizes code around objects and their interactions, making it ideal for complex, scalable software systems.

6. **How do you ensure your code is maintainable and scalable? Can you discuss any design patterns or architectural principles you’ve implemented in your projects?**

I use OOP for projects requiring complex state management and functional programming for stateless, data-heavy tasks. I’ve implemented design patterns such as Factory for object creation, Observer for event handling, and Strategy for dynamic algorithm selection. Additionally, I prioritize thorough commenting, clear documentation, and efficient code practices to ensure maintainability and scalability.

7. **Discuss your experience with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have you worked with any front-end frameworks like React or Angular?**

I have extensive experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I've used React for building dynamic and responsive web applications, and began tinkering with the Chrome DevTools as a youngin’ back in ’15! Although my experience with Angular is more limited, by having strong foundations in other JS frameworks like Vue, Next.js, and Nuxt.js, I have enough transferrable knowledge and could quickly adapt to Angular.

8. **Describe a time when you had to learn a new programming language or technology on the job. How did you approach the learning process, and how quickly were you able to become proficient?**

At my last startup, Carbon Arc, I had to quickly get up to speed with Enterprise Plotly Dash to build on and contribute to our web-framework & data visualization framework. I approached this by first immersing myself in the official documentation and then learning by doing: building, iterating, debugging, optimizing, and collaborating with those more experienced. Within a few weeks, I was proficient enough to add 6 new dashboards to our product and by the end of my co-op I singlehandedly proposed & migrated the data analytics team onto a more established & robust, leading-edge frontend via plotly dash-bootstrap-components & a custom-made Bootswatch theme.

9. **What steps do you take to balance demanding client requirements?**

Balancing demanding client requirements involves clear communication, prioritization, and flexibility. First, I ensure a thorough understanding of client needs through detailed discussions and constant feedback loops. Next, I prioritize tasks based on urgency and impact, creating a structured timeline that allows for iterative progress and adjustments. Finally, I maintain flexibility, being prepared to adapt to changing requirements while keeping the project’s core objectives in focus. This approach ensures that client expectations are met without compromising the quality or integrity of the project.

10. **Walk me through your portfolio. Which pieces are you most proud of, and why?**

To delve into a sampling of my portfolio... First, in "Topology Diffusion: AI for Optimization Engineering", I developed an AI-driven framework to optimize antenna topologies using a bleeding-edge topological diffusion model for research purposes, demonstration, and education for my lab members. For the "Baseball Tracking Capstone Team", I designed a low-cost system integrating RADAR and video for real-time baseball tracking, aimed at enhancing accessibility for little league teams in the culmination of engineering degree. Lastly, as a core member of the "Population Micro-Targeting Architecture" project at my last startup, in a 3-week push I helped build an advanced project to query petabytes of data in minutes, perform automated MLOps, optimize our amazon VPC & Athena parquet partitioning, and ultimately deliver a F500 C-suite class closed set of tool in a full Data Engineering, Full Stack Application, and MLOops project; it delivered significant business value and singlehandedly tripled our revenue. I'm most proud of the last project, "Pop. µ-Targeting Arch.", due to the amount I learned and the business value that was so clearly added from what we created.

11. **Tell me about yourself and your last/current job/class?**

For employment I'm currently doing some freelance data consulting for startups in the New York area. I recently worked with a urban vertical farming startup called RediFarms and upon winning a DOE startup grant, helped them research & refine the projected CO2e emissions were they at scale and dented the global industrial food transport & agriculture business. This endeavor involved extensive agro-climate research, delving into & computing complex geo data transformations utilizing raw research data & the USDA NASS's crop sequence boundaries map, combining & statistically evaluating several datasets together, and designing a calculator for the founders to generate up-to-date calculations based on live business projections in the future.

12. **How do you prioritize your work as a Junior Software Engineer?**

I prioritize by understanding project requirements and deadlines, and principally deliverable prioritization. Then, I prefer to employ agile methodologies and version-controlled markdown notes to organize tasks by urgency and impact. As a junior engineer, I also greatly value having at least a weekly 1-on-1 with my supervisor in order to make sure our team is in sync and remains flexible & adaptable. 

13. **How much will you request per hour if you are hired?**

The listed compensation is $70/hr. I request & expect the same.

14. **How well do you handle constructive criticism about your Software development projects? Can you give me an example?**

I always request constructive criticism & make it known that my door (or slack DMs) are left open for it! Not only does constructive criticism foster and expedite personal growth and intellectual development, but it draws teams and coworkers nearer and hastens development. I'm a curious person by nature and .

To draw a recent example, this past Fall in my research position, I conducted and refined numerous technical presentations with our lab's PhD focus group on the design principles & latest research of designing low-power, isotropic, passive, small-loop MEMS & NEMS 3D antennae. In preparation for IEEE Conferences, these were always rigorously & thoroughly scrutinized to find the limits of ones knowledge, subject matter expertise, limitations of the presentation, and further paths of study—often for periods greater than the presentation. While intense, this level of criticism and open communication nurtured the minds of our lab like no other environment I've been in.

Having read the work of Radical Candor by Kim Scott should be an essential plight of any technical engineer.
